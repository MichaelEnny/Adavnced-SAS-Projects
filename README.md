### Patient Readmission Rates Analysis:

-- Objective: Identify factors contributing to patient readmission within 30 days of discharge.
-- Steps: Import data, flag readmission, compute descriptive statistics, and perform logistic regression to identify significant predictors.
Length of Stay Prediction:

### Length of Stay Prediction:

-- Objective: Develop a model to predict patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic characteristics.
-- Steps: Import and clean data, compute correlations, perform multiple linear regression, and output predicted LOS.
Survival Analysis for Patient Outcomes:

### Survival Analysis for Patient Outcomes:
-- Objective: Conduct survival analysis to understand patient survival rates post-treatment and identify factors affecting survival.
-- Steps: Import and prepare data, compute Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and run a Cox proportional hazards model to analyze survival factors.
